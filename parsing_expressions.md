## Parsing Expressions

```
expression     → literal
               | unary
               | binary
               | grouping ;

literal        → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" ;
grouping       → "(" expression ")" ;
unary          → ( "-" | "!" ) expression ;
binary         → expression operator expression ;
operator       → "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
               | "+"  | "-"  | "*" | "/" ;
```

After removing the ambiguity

```
expression     → equality ;
equality       → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
comparison     → term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
term           → factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
factor         → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
unary          → ( "!" | "-" ) unary
               | primary ;
primary        → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" | IDENTIFIER
               | "(" expression ")" ;
```

## Statements

```
program        → statement* EOF ;

statement      → exprStmt
               | printStmt ;

exprStmt       → expression ";" ;
printStmt      → "print" expression ";" ;
```

## Variable syntax

```
program        → declaration* EOF ;

declaration    → varDecl
               | statement ;

statement      → exprStmt
               | printStmt ;

varDecl        → "var" IDENTIFIER ( "=" expression )? ";" ;
```

## Assignment syntax

```
expression     → assignment ;
assignment     → IDENTIFIER "=" assignment
               | equality ;
```

```
statement      → exprStmt
               | printStmt
               | block ;

block          → "{" declaration* "}" ;
```
